<h1 align="center">Flight Tracker</h1>

"Flight Tracker" is a final exam project from the course "Mobile Application Development" at Singidunum University. The course was designed to teach students the fundamentals of Android development using Android Studio and native components (Activities, Fragments, etc.). For the final project, students were tasked to create an android application on a free topic.

The topic for this project was a "Flight tracker" which is used to track flights from the "Nikola Tesla" Airport in Belgrade. Although the topic was free, there were some minimal requirements that the project should be met. Mainly, the project had to have at least 3 Activities, should use one external API and to store files locally on the mobile device (shared preferences, SQLite database, etc.).

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Login Activity
- Register Activity
